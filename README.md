# Sales-Prediction
### Sales Prediction Analysis

This notebook provides an analysis for predicting sales based on advertising data using various data science and machine learning techniques. Below is a summary of the steps and processes undertaken in the notebook:

#### Importing Libraries
The necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning are imported:
- `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation
- `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for data visualization
- `sklearn` for machine learning models and evaluation

#### Data Loading and Initial Exploration
The advertising dataset is loaded from a CSV file, followed by an initial exploration:
- Displaying the dataset and checking its structure
- Verifying data types and checking for missing values

#### Data Visualization
Several visualizations are created to understand the data better:
- Pairplot to visualize relationships between advertising channels and sales
- Heatmap to show the correlation between different features

#### Feature Selection
The features (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and target (Sales) variables are selected for model training:
- Separating features (`X`) and target (`y`) variables

#### Model Training
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
- Training a Linear Regression model on the training data
- Making predictions on the testing data

#### Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared value (RÂ²)

#### Visualization of Predicted vs. Actual Sales
A scatter plot is created to visualize the relationship between actual and predicted sales.

#### Using the Model for Predictions
The model is used to predict sales based on new advertising data inputs.

#### Conclusion
This notebook provides a detailed approach to data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, and model training to predict sales based on advertising data. The steps outlined ensure a thorough and methodical approach to handling and analyzing the dataset.

This analysis and the steps involved can serve as a valuable reference for similar machine learning projects, highlighting the importance of data preparation and proper evaluation metrics.
